# My configuration for Alacritty (WIP)

I decided to make the switch from st to Alacritty due to my inability to get undercurls working.
Also the configuration of Alacritty is easier to manage.

# Colorscheme

Dark purple to integrate with AwesomeWM, dmenu and Neovim

# planned keybinds

+ Vi like movement
+ RegEx hints with several actions piped to dmenu
